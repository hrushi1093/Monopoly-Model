# Monopoly-Model

Monopoly is a fast-dealing property trading board game and is one of the most popular and well-known board games across the world, with multiple variations throughout history. Every game is different and is difficult to generalise and through our stochastic model of Monopoly, we will be trying to determine various strategies and techniques to increase the chances of winning.

We will be achieving our goal by simulating a board of monopoly with all its intrinsic properties, for example, Go To Jail space, Go space, Jail space, etc. Following this, we will be simulating the probability rolls which include the 2 dice, and also other components which are based on random draws such as the community chest and chance spaces.

Landing probability is defined as the probability of a player ending up on a particular tile. We will approximate the landing probability of each space by running a Monte Carlo Simulation which will approximate the distributions by repeated random sampling. The performance of each property depends on the revenue, the cost, and the landing probability. Based on these parameters and strategies that we developed we create a heuristic to score properties and hence, devise strategies that increase the chances of winning an arbitrary game.
